/*Your friend Arnav has asked you to complete a very challenging task: arranging his cars. Arnav says that if you arrange his cars correctly, you get to keep one! Arnav knows that he values brand more than color and some colors more than others, but still has a very tough time arranging his cars from his most favorite to least favorite.

Arnav gives you a list of cars and colors in order from most favorite to least favorite, and a list of his cars along with their colors. Can you help Arnav?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer T - the number of test cases. T will be at most 10.

Each test case will contain a positive integer U - the number of different types of cars Arnav has, a positive integer V - the number of different colors of cars Arnav has, and a positive integer W - the number of cars Arnav has. U and V will be at most 10, W will be at most 20.

The next U lines contain a single word representing a type of car in order from most favorite to least favorite.

The next V lines after that contain a single word representing a color of cars in order from most favorite to least favorite.

The last W lines will contain a single word representing the brand of Arnav’s car, along with another word representing the color of that car.

Output

Print out the brand and color of each of Arnav’s cars in order from his most favorite to least favorite in the correct order, according to his brand and color specifications.
