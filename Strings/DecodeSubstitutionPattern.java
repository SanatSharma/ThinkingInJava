/*Amy and May aren't allowed by their parents to have cell phones, so they still communitcate in class the good old fashioned way, by writing notes.

So that no snoopy teachers can read any found notes, the girls communicate in code.

May is having a hard time deciphering Amy's latest messages, can you help her figure it out?

Input: String written in Amy's code Output: String decoded to Engligh so May can read it
eg "OMG MAY YOUR DRESS IS SO CUTE",NotePassing.decipher("HFZ FTR RHNK WKXLL BL LH VNMX")
"Hey May! Which teacher do you think is nicer, Mr. Jones or Mrs. Patel?",NotePassing.decipher("Axr Ftr! Pabva mxtvaxk wh rhn mabgd bl gbvxk, Fk. Chgxl hk Fkl. Itmxe?" )
"school is so boring i can't believe there are so many hours left", NotePassing.decipher("lvahhe bl lh uhkbgz b vtg'm uxebxox maxkx tkx lh ftgr ahnkl exym"
